Other Community Tools
=====================

There are several other community tools that are useful for evaluating models 
against observations for weather, atmospheric chemistry, or atmospheric 
composition applications. We summarize these tools below and include details 
on how MELODIES MONET connects or plans to connect with them when applicable.

This list is under development. If you are interested in connecting your tool
with MELODIES MONET, please email us at melodies@ucar.edu. Please refer to the
`MELODIES MONET project board <https://github.com/orgs/NCAR/projects/150/>`__ 
under milestone "Connect To Other Model Evaluation Tools" to learn more about 
this activity.

METPlus
-------

The `Model Evaluation Tools (METplus) <https://dtcenter.org/community-code/metplus>`__
verification system is an extensive system for evaluating meteorology in a variety of
models including NOAA's Unified Forecasting System (UFS) and NCAR's System for Integrated
Modeling of the Atmosphere (SIMA) against observations. We are interested in connecting 
some of METplus capabilities into MELODIES MONET. Please refer to the
`MELODIES MONET project board <https://github.com/orgs/NCAR/projects/150/>`__ 
under milestone "Connect MELODIES MONET to METplus" to learn more about this activity.

EViz
----

The NASA `EViz tool <https://astg.pages.smce.nasa.gov/visualization/eviz/>`__
has capabilities to process model output and create diagnostic plots.
Discussions have started to explore how MELODIES MONET and EViz can collaborate more
together.
