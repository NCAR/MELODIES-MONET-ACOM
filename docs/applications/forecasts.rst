Evaluating Air Quality Forecasts
================================

RAP-chem
--------

Jordan Schnell at NOAA GSL is using MELODIES MONET to evaluate the performance 
of a variety of research and operational air quality forecast models 
including a newly developed research forecast model called RAP-chem every day 
in near real time against the AirNow surface observations of ozone, PM\ :sub:`2.5`\, 
CO, and NO\ :sub:`2` and AERONET AOD measurements.

Check out the full analysis for each forecast `here <https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/RAPchemEPA/>`__.

This includes a new feature developed by NOAA GSL summer student, Mackenzie Arnold,
to `interactively view plots for individual surface sites online <https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/RAPchemEPAsites/>`__.

The code to produce this analysis using MELODIES MONET is in the
``examples/forecast_evaluation`` folder on GitHub.

Example plots for ozone and PM\ :sub:`2.5` for the forecast on January 18th, 2022 
are below.
